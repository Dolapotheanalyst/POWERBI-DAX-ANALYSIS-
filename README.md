## DAX with Awesome Chocolate Dataset  

### Description  
As a data analyst working with Power BI, I often need to extract meaningful insights from sales data using *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). This dataset, **Awesome Chocolate, includes multiple tables such as **Locations, People, Products, and Sales*.  

In this post, I will demonstrate how to use DAX to answer key business questions, including *total revenue, shipment counts, product diversity, and sales performance per geography. By leveraging functions like **SUM, COUNTROWS, DISTINCTCOUNT, and CALCULATE*, I can generate critical insights that drive data-driven decision-making.

### Introduction  
As a data analyst working with Power BI, I often need to *gain insights from sales data* using *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)*.  
In this analysis, I am working with the *Awesome Chocolate Dataset*, which consists of the following tables:  
- *Locations Table*  
- *People Table*  
- *Products Table*  
- *Sales Table*  

Using DAX, I will *answer key business questions* related to sales, shipments, and product performance.

### What is the Total Money We Have Generated Per Individual Geography?  
In the *Sales Table, the **Amount Column* represents the revenue generated.  

Using *DAX*, I calculated the total amount generated by Awesome Chocolate:  

*Total Amount = SUM(Sales[Amount])*  

This provides insight into the *total revenue* generated across different locations.  

---

### What is the Total Boxes Sold in Each Geography?  
The *Sales Table* contains a *Boxes column*, which records the total number of boxes sold.  

To determine the total number of boxes sold, I used:  

*Total Boxes = SUM(Sales[Boxes])*  

This helps track the *volume of product sales* across different regions.  

---

### How Many Shipments Are We Making?  
Each salesperson in the *Sales Table* is responsible for shipments.  

To calculate the *total number of shipments made*, I used:  

*Shipment Count = COUNTROWS(Sales)*  

This metric helps understand *shipment frequency and logistics performance*.  

---

### What is the Amount Per Shipment That We Are Making?  
To determine the *average revenue per shipment*, I used:  

*Amount per Shipment = Total Amount / Shipment Count*  

This metric helps analyze *financial efficiency per shipment*.

### Which Salesperson Meets the Target of 4,800?  
*Target per shipment: 4,800*  

To determine if a salesperson met the target, I used the *IF function*:  

*Target Achieved = IF(Amount Per Shipment > 4,800, "Yes", "No")*  

#### Key Findings:  
- *13 salespersons* met the target.  
- To make the results visually clear, I used *emoji indicators*:  
  - *ðŸ˜Š (Smiling Face)* if the target is met.  
  - *ðŸ˜° (Crying Face with Sweat)* if the target is not met.  

This *visual approach* makes it easy to identify high-performing employees.

### How Many Different Products Did a Salesperson Sell?  
To count the *number of unique products* sold by each salesperson, I used:  

*Count of Products = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[Product])*  

This metric helps analyze *sales diversity per employee*.  

---

### How Many Shipments Have a Lower Number of Boxes?  
To determine *shipments with fewer than 15 boxes, I used the **CALCULATE function*:  

*Low Box Shipment = CALCULATE(Shipment Count, Sales[Boxes] < 15)*  

To calculate the *percentage of shipments* that had fewer than 15 boxes:  

*Low Box Shipment (%) = DIVIDE(Low Box Shipment, Shipment Count) * 100*  

This helps assess *small-volume shipments and their impact on logistics*.  

---

### How Many Shipments Does "Bar" Have in Each Product Category?  
To find out how many shipments the *"Bars" product category* has, I used:  

*CALCULATE(Shipment Count, Product[Category] = "Bars")*  

This metric provides insights into the *shipment frequency of the "Bars" product category*.  

---

## Conclusion  
Working with *DAX in Power BI* has allowed me to extract valuable insights from the *Awesome Chocolate Dataset*.  
By using *SUM, COUNTROWS, DISTINCTCOUNT, IF, and CALCULATE functions*, I was able to analyze:  
- *Total revenue and box sales per geography*  
- *Shipment count and revenue per shipment*  
- *Salespersons meeting revenue targets*  
- *Product diversity per salesperson*  
- *Shipment trends for small-volume and category-specific sales*  

These insights are crucial for *improving sales strategies, optimizing logistics, and tracking performance at a granular level*.  

DAX continues to be a *powerful tool for data analysis*, helping me make data-driven decisions with ease! ðŸš€
